# Solve Optimal Control problem

A classical optimal control problem is the rocket launching problem(aka [Goddard Rocket problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goddard_problem)). Say we have a rocket with limited fuel and is launched vertically. And we want to control the final altitude of this rocket so that we can make the best of the limited fuel in rocket to get to the highest altitude. In this optimal control problem, the state variables are:

  - Velocity of the rocket: $x_v(t)$
  - Altitude of the rocket: $x_h(t)$
  - Mass of the rocket and the fuel: $x_m(t)$

The control variable is

  - Thrust of the rocket: $u_t(t)$

The dynamics of the launching can be formulated with three differential equations:

$$
\left\{\begin{aligned}
&\frac{dx_v}{dt}=\frac{u_t-drag(x_h,x_v)}{x_m}-g(x_h)\\
&\frac{dx_h}{dt}=x_v\\
&\frac{dx_m}{dt}=-\frac{u_t}{c}
\end{aligned}\right.
$$

where the drag $D(x_h,x_v)$ is a function of altitude and velocity:

$$
D(x_h,x_v)=D_c\cdot x_v^2\cdot\exp^{h_c(\frac{x_h-x_h(0)}{x_h(0)})}
$$

gravity $g(x_h)$ is a function of altitude:

$$
g(x_h)=g_0\cdot (\frac{x_h(0)}{x_h})^2
$$

$c$ is a constant. Suppose the final time is $T$, we here want to maximize the final altitude $x_h(T)$:

$$
\max x_h(T)
$$

The inequality constraints for the state variables and control variables are:

$$
\left\{\begin{aligned}
&x_v>0\\
&x_h>0\\
&m_T<x_m<m_0\\
&0<u_t<u_{t\text{max}}
\end{aligned}\right.
$$

Similar solving for such optimal control problem can be found on JuMP.jl and InfiniteOpt.jl. The detailed parameters are taken from [COPS](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/%7Emore/cops/cops3.pdf).
