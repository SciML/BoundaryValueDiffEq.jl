For example, we use the problem from Ascher et al. [3] in this tutorial:\n\nε y + xy = ε pi^2cos(pi x) - pi xsin(pi x)\n\nfor ε = 10^-4, on tin-11 with two point boundary conditions y(-1)=-2, y(1)=0. With analytical solution of y(x) = cos(pi x) + operatornameerf(xsqrt2ε)operatornameerf(1sqrt2ε), this problem has a rapid transition layer at x=0, making it difficult to solve numerically. In this tutorial, we will showcase how to use continuation with BoundaryValueDiffEq.jl to solve this BVP.\n\nWe use the substitution to transform this problem into a first order BVP system:\n\nbeginalign*\ny_1= y_2 \ny_2= -fracxε y_2 - pi^2cos(pi x) - fracpi xε sin(pi x)\nendalign*\n\nSince this BVP would become difficult to solve when 0εll 1, we start the continuation with relatively bigger ε to first obtain a good initial guess for cases when epsilon are becoming extremely small. We can just use the previous solution from BVP solving as the initial guess u0 when constructing a new BVProblem.\n\nusing BoundaryValueDiffEq, Plots\nfunction f!(du, u, p, t)\n    du[1] = u[2]\n    du[2] = -t / p * u[2] - pi^2 * cospi(t) - pi * t / p * sinpi(t)\nend\nfunction bc!(res, u, p, t)\n    res[1] = u[1][1] + 2\n    res[2] = u[end][1]\nend\ntspan = (-1.0, 1.0)\nsol = [1.0, 0.0]\ne = 0.1\nfor i in 2:4\n    global e = e / 10\n    prob = BVProblem(f!, bc!, sol, tspan, e)\n    global sol = solve(prob, MIRK4(), dt = 0.01)\nend\nplot(sol, idxs = [1])\n\nIn the iterative solving, the intermediate solutions are each used as the initial guess for the next problem solving.","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorials/continuation/#On-providing-initial-guess","page":"Solve BVP with Continuation","title":"On providing initial guess","text":"There are several ways of providing initial guess in BVProblem/TwoPointBVProblem:\n\nSolution from BVP/ODE solving from SciML packages with ODESolution type.\nVectorOfArray from RecursiveArrayTools.jl.\nDiffEqArray from RecursiveArrayTools.jl.\nFunction handle of the form f(p, t) for specifying initial guess on time span.\nAbstractArray represent only the possible initial condition.","category":"section"},{"location":"references/#References","page":"References","title":"References","text":"P. H. Muir and M. F. Adams.

Instead, we may encounter scenarios where constraints are imposed on the maximum or minimum values that the solution must attain somewhere within the domain. In such cases, we can use the maxsol and minsol functions provided by BoundaryValueDiffEq.jl to specify such extremum boundary conditions.\n\nLet's walk through this functionality with an intuitive example. We still revisit the simple pendulum example here, but this time, suppose we need to impose the maximum and minimum value to our boundary conditions, specified as:\n\nmaxu=ub\nminu=lb\n\nwhere lb=-4.8161991710010925 and ub=5.0496477654230745.

This approach allows us to incorporate both the governing differential equations and boundary conditions to infer parameters that may not be directly measurable.\n\nLet's walk through this functionality with an intuitive example. In the following tutorial, we use the Mathieu equation which is a second-order differential equation:\n\ny+(lambda-2qcos(2x))y=0\n\nwhere lambda is the unknown parameter we wish to estimate, q is a known real-valued parameter, with boundary conditions when q=5:\n\ny(0)=0 y(pi)=0\n\nThe second-order BVP can be transformed into a first-order system of BVP:\n\nbegincases\ny_1=y_2\ny_2=-(lambda-2qcos(2x))y_1\nendcases\n\nwith boundary conditions of\n\ny_2(0)=0 y_2(pi)=0\n\nIt is worthnoting that in this system, while we have two differetial equations, it isn't enough to estimate the unknown parameters and guarantee a unique numerical solution with only two given boundary conditions. While under the hood, the parameters are estimated simultaneously with the numerical solution, it makes the boundary value problem an underconstrained BVP if the number of constraints are equal to the number of states, which may result in more than one solution. So we should provide additional constraint y(0)=1 from the original equation to make sure unique numerical solution and the estimated parameters are we actually wanted.\n\nWith BoundaryValueDiffEq.jl, it's easy to solve boundary value problems with unknown parameters, we can just specify fit_parameters=true when constructing the BVP and provide the guess of the unknown parameters in prob.p, for example, to estimate the unknown parameters in the above BVP system:\n\nusing BoundaryValueDiffEq, Plots\ntspan = (0.0, pi)\nfunction f!(du, u, p, t)\n    du[1] = u[2]\n    du[2] = -(p[1] - 10 * cos(2 * t)) * u[1]\nend\nfunction bca!(res, u, p)\n    res[1] = u[2]\n    res[2] = u[1] - 1.0\nend\nfunction bcb!(res, u, p)\n    res[1] = u[2]\nend\nguess(p, t) = [cos(4t); -4sin(4t)]\nbvp = TwoPointBVProblem(f!, (bca!, bcb!), guess, tspan, [15.0],\n    bcresid_prototype = (zeros(2), zeros(1)), fit_parameters = true)\nsol = solve(bvp, MIRK4(), dt = 0.05)\nplot(sol)\n\nafter solving the boundary value problem, the estimated unknown parameters can be accessed in the solution\n\nsol.prob.p","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorials/solve_nlls_bvp/#Solve-Overdetermined-and-Underdetermined-BVP","page":"Solve Overdetermined and Underdetermined BVP","title":"Solve Overdetermined and Underdetermined BVP","text":"When there are more or less boundary conditions than the states in a boundary value problem, the BVP would become an overdetermined or underdetermined boundary value problem.
