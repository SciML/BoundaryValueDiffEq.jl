        ## Keyword Arguments

          - `nlsolve`: Internal Nonlinear solver. Any solver which conforms to the SciML

            the solver will be ignored and a custom jacobian algorithm will be used.

          - `optimize`: Internal Optimization solver. Any solver which conforms to the SciML
            `OptimizationProblem` interface can be used. Note that any autodiff argument for
            the solver will be ignored and a custom jacobian algorithm will be used.
          - `jac_alg`: Jacobian Algorithm used for the nonlinear solver. Defaults to
            `BVPJacobianAlgorithm()`, which automatically decides the best algorithm to
            use based on the input types and problem type.

              + For `TwoPointBVProblem`, only `diffmode` is used (defaults to
                `AutoSparse(AutoForwardDiff)` if possible else `AutoSparse(AutoFiniteDiff)`).
              + For `BVProblem`, `bc_diffmode` and `nonbc_diffmode` are used. For
                `nonbc_diffmode` defaults to `AutoSparse(AutoForwardDiff)` if possible else
                `AutoSparse(AutoFiniteDiff)`. For `bc_diffmode`, defaults to `AutoForwardDiff` if
                possible else `AutoFiniteDiff`.
          - `nested_nlsolve`: Whether or not to use a nested nonlinear solve for the
            implicit FIRK step. Defaults to `false`. If set to `false`, the FIRK stages are
            solved as a part of the global residual. The general recommendation is to choose
            `true` for larger problems and `false` for smaller ones.
          - `nest_tol`: The tolerance for the nested solver. Default is nothing which leads to
            `NonlinearSolve` automatically selecting the tolerance.
          - `defect_threshold`: Threshold for defect control.
          - `max_num_subintervals`: Number of maximal subintervals, default as 3000.
